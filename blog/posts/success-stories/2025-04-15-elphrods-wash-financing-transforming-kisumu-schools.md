# How Elphrods WASH Financing is Transforming Kisumu Schools

In the bustling lakeside city of Kisumu, access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities has long been a challenge for many schools. With limited government funding and high costs for infrastructure development, many educational institutions found themselves struggling to provide adequate WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) facilities for their students.

## The Challenge

Manyatta Primary School, located in Kisumu's densely populated Manyatta neighborhood, faced significant WASH-related challenges that were affecting student health and attendance:

- Unreliable water supply during dry seasons
- Outdated and insufficient toilet facilities
- No handwashing stations near latrines
- High rates of water-borne illnesses among students

"We were spending considerable funds on water trucking during shortages," explains Headteacher Mary Akinyi. "Our pit latrines were old and insufficient for our growing student population of 845 children. We knew we needed improvements but couldn't afford the upfront costs."

## The Elphrods Solution

Through Elphrods' **Msingi Bora School Loan** program, Manyatta Primary received financing of KES 350,000 to implement comprehensive WASH improvements:

1. Installation of a 10,000-liter water storage system
2. Construction of new VIP latrines with separate facilities for boys and girls
3. Development of handwashing stations strategically placed near eating areas and toilets
4. Connection to the main city water pipeline for consistent supply

The loan featured terms specifically designed for school budgets:
- 24-month repayment period 
- Flexible payment schedule aligned with school fee collection periods
- Competitive interest rate of 9% (compared to 15-20% from traditional lenders)

## Measurable Results

Six months after implementing these WASH improvements, Manyatta Primary reported:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Student attendance rate | 78% | 92% | +14% |
| Water-related illnesses | 31% of health visits | 8% of health visits | -23% |
| Monthly water costs | KES 25,000 | KES 8,500 | -66% |
| Sanitation facilities | 1:65 toilet-to-student ratio | 1:25 toilet-to-student ratio | +60% improvement |

"The improvements have transformed our school environment," says Akinyi. "Parents are more confident sending their children to school, knowing they have access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities."

## Expanding Impact Across Kisumu

Manyatta Primary is just one of 12 schools across Kisumu County that have benefited from Elphrods' WASH financing solutions. Collectively, these improvements have impacted over 7,500 students in the region.

Other schools that have implemented similar projects include:

- Nyalenda Community School
- Obunga Primary
- Kibuye Academy
- St. Mary's Girls School

## The Ripple Effect

Beyond the immediate health and attendance improvements, schools report additional benefits:

- **Girls' education:** Improved privacy and sanitation facilities have particularly benefited adolescent girls, who previously missed school during menstruation
- **Environmental impact:** Proper waste management has reduced contamination of local water sources
- **Community education:** Students bring WASH knowledge home, influencing household practices
- **Financial sustainability:** Schools save money on water purchases and healthcare interventions

## Looking Forward

Elphrods plans to expand its Kisumu operations in 2025, with a goal of reaching 25 additional schools in previously underserved areas of the county, particularly in the rural periphery.

"The demand for WASH financing in Kisumu's educational institutions remains high," explains Jacob Odhiambo, Elphrods' Regional Manager for Kisumu. "We're working with local authorities and water providers to streamline connections and ensure sustainable solutions."

Schools interested in applying for WASH financing can contact our Kisumu office located at Manyatta Primary School, Bio-Centre First Floor, or call 0796 864 084 to schedule a consultation.
