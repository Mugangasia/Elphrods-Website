# Kisumu's WASH Market: Opportunities and Challenges for Service Providers

Kisumu County, Kenya's third-largest city and a vital Lake Victoria port, presents a unique landscape of challenges and opportunities in the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sector. As Elphrods expands its financing solutions in this region, we've compiled key market insights for WASH service providers and entrepreneurs considering entering or expanding in this promising market.

## Market Overview: Kisumu County

Kisumu County's WASH sector is characterized by several defining factors:

- **Population:** Approximately 1.2 million residents (2022 census data)
- **Urbanization rate:** 52% urban, with rapid growth in peri-urban areas
- **Water access:** 67% of households have access to improved water sources
- **Sanitation coverage:** Only 41% have access to adequate sanitation facilities
- **Annual WASH investment:** Estimated at KES 1.2 billion (public and private combined)

## Growth Drivers in Kisumu's WASH Sector

Several factors are creating unprecedented opportunities for WASH service providers in Kisumu:

### 1. County Government Initiatives

The Kisumu County Government has prioritized WASH development in its 2023-2027 Integrated Development Plan, allocating KES 350 million annually for water infrastructure and sanitation improvements. This includes:

- Expansion of the main water supply network
- Rehabilitation of community water points
- Public sanitation facility development in informal settlements
- Regulatory reforms to encourage private sector participation

### 2. Urbanization Patterns

Kisumu's rapid urbanization (5.4% annual growth) is creating concentrated demand for WASH services, particularly in emerging neighborhoods like:

- Riat Hills
- Mamboleo
- Nyamasaria
- Kibos

These areas represent high-potential markets for water connection services, modern sanitation solutions, and professional pit emptying.

### 3. Health Awareness

Following recent cholera outbreaks in 2023, public awareness and demand for improved sanitation have increased significantly. Our customer surveys indicate 78% of Kisumu residents now rank clean water and proper sanitation as "very important" compared to 52% in 2021.

## Key Opportunity Areas for Service Providers

Based on our financing data and market research, we've identified these high-potential business opportunities in Kisumu's WASH sector:

### Water Connection and Distribution

- **Last-mile connections:** While main water lines have expanded, many households lack the funds for final connection points
- **Water storage solutions:** Rainwater harvesting systems and storage tanks (5,000-10,000 liters most popular)
- **Water treatment services:** Point-of-use filtration and purification systems

### Sanitation Services

- **Pit emptying:** Professional emptying services for existing latrines (market currently underserved)
- **Modern toilet construction:** Especially pour-flush toilets connected to septic systems
- **Septic tank installation:** Growing demand in areas without sewer connections
- **Public toilet operations:** Pay-per-use facilities in commercial areas

### Hygiene Products and Services

- **Handwashing stations:** Particularly for schools and small businesses
- **Soap and hygiene product distribution:** Local production and distribution networks
- **Hygiene education services:** School and community programs

## Financing as a Market Catalyst

Our data shows that lack of financing remains the primary barrier to WASH improvements. Among surveyed Kisumu residents:

- 68% want to improve their water or sanitation facilities
- 81% cite upfront costs as the main barrier
- 76% would proceed with improvements if affordable financing was available

This financing gap represents the opportunity Elphrods is addressing through our loan products for both consumers and WASH service providers.

## Challenges and Considerations

Service providers entering the Kisumu market should be aware of these challenges:

### Regulatory Environment

- **Permits and licensing:** Water service provision requires approval from Kisumu Water and Sanitation Company (KIWASCO)
- **Quality standards:** Increasing enforcement of national standards for sanitation services
- **Environmental regulations:** Particularly for waste disposal and treatment

### Seasonal Factors

- **Rainy seasons (March-May, October-December):** Increased demand for pit emptying due to flooding risks
- **Dry periods (January-February):** Higher demand for water delivery services

### Competition Landscape

The Kisumu WASH market includes:

- 7 established water delivery companies
- 12 registered pit emptying services (insufficient for market demand)
- 4 toilet construction specialists
- Various informal service providers

## Partnership Opportunities with Elphrods

Elphrods offers several advantages to WASH service providers in Kisumu:

1. **Pre-qualified customers:** Access to customers with approved financing
2. **Payment security:** Direct disbursement of funds for completed work
3. **Business loans:** Working capital for equipment and expansion
4. **Training opportunities:** Technical and business management skills

Our "Certified Service Provider" program now has 8 partners in Kisumu, with capacity to add 5-10 more in 2025.

## Conclusion: A Growing Market with Strong Potential

Kisumu's WASH sector presents significant opportunities for service providers who can overcome initial barriers to entry. With the combination of:

- Strong government support
- Increasing consumer demand
- Available financing solutions
- Growing health awareness

The conditions are favorable for sustainable business growth in this essential sector.
